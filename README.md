# WT Typescript / Javascript Repo Template

## Overview

This is a template repository to be used for `node.js` and browser-based package / project development. This repository contains the base tools required for linting, building, packaging and deploying to `npmjs`. Tools used include:

- eslint
- prettier
- git-cz
- conventional commits
- typescript
- dotenv

## Commits

To commit to the repository after staging the files for commit:

```bash
yarn commit
```

Select the appropriate type of commit message, any issues to close, and note any breaking changes.

**Note**: This will enforce _conventional commit messages_ and _GPG signatures_ on commits.
